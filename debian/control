Description: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the NTP daemon and utility programs.  An NTP
 daemon needs to be running on each host that is to have its clock
 accuracy controlled by NTP.  The same NTP daemon is also used to
 provide NTP service to other hosts.
 .
 This is the NTPsec version of NTP.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened,
 and improved implementation derived from the original NTP project.
 NTPsec supports Network Time Security (NTS) which provides
 cryptographically authenticated time.
 .
 For more information about the NTP protocol and NTP server
 configuration and operation, install the package "ntpsec-doc".

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 This is the NTPsec version of ntpdate.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened,
 and improved implementation derived from the original NTP project.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntpsec" is installed, then
 ntpsec-ntpdate is not necessary.

Description: ntpdig SNTP client
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdig can be used as an SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server
 and either display the time or set the local system's time.  It is not
 sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the long run.
 .
 This is the NTPsec version of ntpdig, which is equivalent to the sntp
 utility.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved implementation
 derived from the original NTP project.

Description: NTP statistics graphing utility
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpviz analyzes NTP log files and generates statistical plots from
 them.  The output is in the form of HTML with images.  If Apache is
 installed, it will be served at: /ntpviz

 This is part of NTPsec.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved
