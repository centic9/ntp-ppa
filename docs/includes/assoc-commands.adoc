// Syntax and usage of association commands.  This is included

In these commands, an _address_ can be any of (a) an IPV4 address in
a.b.c.d format, (b) an IPV6 address in [a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h] format, (c) a
link-local IPV6 address with an interface specified in
[a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h]%device format, or (d) a DNS hostname.

+unpeer+ ['address' | 'associd' | +clock+ 'clocktype' [+unit+ 'unitnum']]::
  These four commands specify the time server name or address to be
  used and the mode in which to operate. The _address_ can be either a
  DNS name or an IP address in dotted-quad notation.  If it is a
  refclock, it can be +clock+ followed by a type-unit pair as in the
  +refclock+ directive; a missing unit clause is interpreted as unit
  0.

[[pool]]+pool+::
  For server addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client
  mode association with a number of remote servers. In this mode the
  local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote
  server can never be synchronized to the local clock.

[[server]]+server+::
  For server addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client
  mode association with the specified remote server or local radio
  clock. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote
  server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local
  clock.

[[peer]]+peer+::
  NTP peer mode has been removed for security reasons.  peer is now just
  an alias for the server keyword.  See above.

[[unpeer]]+unpeer+::
  This command removes a previously configured association. An address
  or association ID can be used to identify the association. Either an
  IP address or DNS name can be used. This command is most useful when
  supplied via +ntpq+ runtime configuration commands +config+ and
  +config-from-file+.
