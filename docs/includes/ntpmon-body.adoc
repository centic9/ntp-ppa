== Synopsis

+ntpmon+ [-dhnuV] [-D lvl] [-l logfile] [host]

== Description

This program is a real-time status monitor for NTP.  It presents the
same information as the 'peers', 'mrulist', 'rv', and 'cv' commands of
{ntpqman}, but using a split-window display that also includes a
status summary bar, and updates at intervals guaranteed to show status
changes almost as soon as they occur.

(Specifically, the display begins updating once per second and
adjusts itself to poll at twice the frequency of the shortest
polling interval reported in the last peers response.)

The status bar includes the version string of the server being
watched, the (local) time at which it was last updated, and the
current query interval in parens following the date.

There is a detail-display mode that dumps full information about a
single selected peer in a tabular format that makes it relatively easy
to see changing values. However, note that a default-sized terminal
emulator window (usually 25 lines) doesn't have enough room for the
clock variables portion. The only fix for this is to resize your
terminal.

^C cleanly terminates the program. Any keystroke will trigger a poll
and update. A few single-keystroke commands are also interpreted as
commands.

If no hostname is specified on the command line, localhost is monitored.

Here's a breakdown of the peers display in the top window:

And the MRU list in the bottom window:

The refid field is as described under "Event Messages and Status
Words" in the NTP documentation on the Web.

== Commands

a:: Change peer display to apeers mode, showing association IDs.

d:: Toggle detail mode (some peer will be reverse-video highlighted when on).

h:: Display help screen

j:: Select next peer (in select mode); arrow down also works.

k:: Select previous peer (in select mode); arrow up also works.

m:: Toggle MRUlist-only mode; suppresses peer display when on.

n:: Toggle display of hostnames vs. IP addresses vs ntpd supplied names plus
    IP addresses or ntpd supplied names and hostnames (default is hostnames).

o:: Change peer display to opeers mode, showing destination address.

p:: Change peer display to default mode, showing refid.

q:: Cleanly terminate the program.

r:: Change to dextral mode, identical to 'p' save that the refid, tally \
and remote clock are on the right.

s:: Toggle display of only reachable hosts (default is all hosts).

u:: Toggle display of units for time values. (default is off)

w:: Toggle wide mode.

x:: Cleanly terminate the program.

<space>:: Rotate through a/n/o/p display modes.

+:: Increase debugging level.  Output goes to ntpmon.log

-:: Decrease debugging level.

?:: Display help screen

== Options

-d:: Increase output debug message level
- may appear multiple times

-D:: Set the output debug message level
- may appear multiple times

-h:: Print a usage message.

-l:: Logs debug messages to the provided filename

-n:: Show IP addresses (vs. hostnames)

-s, --srcname:: Show srchost first then names and numbers

-S, --srcnumber:: Show srchost first then numbers

-u:: Show units

-V:: Display version and exit.

== Known Bugs

When run in a terminal that does not allow UTF-8 ntpmon will downgrade
its unit display to a non-unicode version. ntpmon has to interact with
the curses and locale libraries, which prevents it from forcing the use
of UTF-8.

When querying a version of ntpd older than NTPsec 0.9.6, +ntpmon+ will
appear to hang when monitoring hosts with extremely long MRU lists -
in particular, public pool hosts. Correct behavior requires a Mode 6
protocol extension not yet present in those versions.

Even with this extension, monitoring a sufficiently high-traffic
server sometimes fails.
