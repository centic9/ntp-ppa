== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
ntplogtemp [-h] [-l LOGFILE] [-o] [-w WAIT] [-v] [-V]

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE
                        append log data to LOGFILE instead of stdout
  -q, --quiet				be quiet
  -o, --once            log one line, then exit
  -w WAIT, --wait WAIT  wait WAIT seconds after each log line, default 60
  -v, --verbose         be verbose
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

== DESCRIPTION

ntplogtemp gathers temperature readings across a system. The standard user
is ntpuser and should have permissions to execute lm_sensors and smartctl.

The default is to write the data to stdout once every 60 seconds.
The log file looks like:

-----------------------------------------------------
# time, sensor, value
1485816568 ZONE0 39.0
1485816568 ZONE1 20.0
1485816568 ZONE2 42.0
1485816568 ZONE3 0.0
-----------------------------------------------------

+Time+ is the POSIX time of when the log line is written.

+Sensor+ is the sensor the temperature reading was obtained from.

+Value+ is the temperature reading in celsius.

== OPTIONS

+-h, --help+::
  Displays usage information and exits.

+-l LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE+::
  Append log data to LOGFILE instead of stdout

+-q, --quiet+::
  Quiet output, will not display errors

+-o, --once+::
  Log the data once, then exit

+-v, --verbose+::
  Be verbose

+-w WAIT, --wait WAIT+::
  Wait WAIT seconds after each log line.  The default is 60 seconds.  The
  minimum wait time is 5 seconds.

+-V, --version+::
 show program's version number and exit

== USAGE

+ntplogtemp+::
  This the simplest use of this program. It can be used to check the
  temperature readings of Zones, CPU, and disk drives every minute.

+ntplogtemp -l /var/log/ntpstats/temperature -w 60 &+::
  This will continuously log the temperature data in the background
  to the file /var/log/ntpstats/temperature.  Only log every 60 seconds.

== EXIT STATUS

One of the following exit values will be returned:

0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)::
  Successful program execution.
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)::
  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
