= Shared Memory Driver
include::include-html.ad[]

== Synopsis

["verse",subs="normal"]
Name: shm
Reference ID: SHM

== Description

This driver receives its reference clock info from a shared
memory-segment. The shared memory-segment is created with owner-only
access by default, unless otherwise requested by the mode word for units
â‰¥2. Units 0 and 1 are always created with owner-only access for backward
compatibility.

== Structure of shared memory-segment

        int    mode; /* 0 - if valid is set:

                      *       clear valid
                      */
        volatile int    count;
        time_t          clockTimeStampSec;
        int             clockTimeStampUSec;
        time_t          receiveTimeStampSec;
        int             receiveTimeStampUSec;
        int             leap;
        int             precision;
        int             nsamples;
        volatile int    valid;
        unsigned        clockTimeStampNSec;     /* Unsigned ns timestamps */
        unsigned        receiveTimeStampNSec;   /* Unsigned ns timestamps */
        int             dummy[8];
};
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Operation mode=0

Each second, the value of +valid+ of the shared memory-segment is
checked:

If set, the values in the record (clockTimeStampSec, clockTimeStampUSec,
receiveTimeStampSec, receiveTimeStampUSec, leap, precision) are passed
to +ntpd+, and +valid+ is cleared and +count+ is incremented.

If not set, +count+ is incremented.

== Operation mode=1

Each second, +valid+ in the shared memory-segment is checked:

If set, the +count+ field of the record is remembered, and the values in
the record (clockTimeStampSec, clockTimeStampUSec, receiveTimeStampSec,
receiveTimeStampUSec, leap, precision) are read. Then, the remembered
+count+ is compared to current value of +count+ now in the record. If
both are equal, the values read from the record are passed to _ntpd_. If
they differ, another process has modified the record while it was read
out (was not able to produce this case), and failure is reported to
_ntpd_. The +valid+ flag is cleared and +count+ is incremented.

If not set, +count+ is incremented.

== Mode-independent post-processing

After the time stamps have been successfully plucked from the SHM
segment, some sanity checks take place:

* The receive time stamp of the SHM data must be within the last 5 seconds
before the time the data is processed. This helps in weeding out stale
data.
* If the absolute difference between remote and local clock exceeds the
limit (either _time2_ or the default of 4 h), then the sample is
discarded. This check is disabled when _flag1_ is set to 1.

== Clockstats

If flag4 is set when the driver is polled, a clockstats record is
written. The first 3 fields are the normal date, time, and source
designator common to all clockstats records.

The 4th field is the number of second ticks since the last poll. The 5th
field is the number of good data samples found. The last 64 will be used
by _ntpd_. The 6th field is the number of sample that didn't have valid
data ready. The 7th field is the number of bad samples. The 8th field is
the number of times the mode 1 info was updated while _ntpd_ was
trying to acquire a sample.

Here is a sample showing the GPS reception fading out:

54364 85505.158 SHM(0)  66  36  30   0   0
54364 85569.157 SHM(0)  64   0  64   0   0
54364 85635.157 SHM(0)  66   0  66   0   0
54364 85700.160 SHM(0)  65   0  65   0   0
------------------------------------------------

The clock identification is normally the driver type and unit, but if
your ntpd was built in strict Classic compatibility mode it will
be a magic clock address expressing the same information in a more
opaque way.

== The \'mode' word

Some aspects of the driver behavior can be adjusted by setting bits of
the mode option of the refclock declaration.

["literal",subs="normal"]
.mode word bits and bit groups
[cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header"]
|=============================================================
| Bit | Dec | Hex | Meaning
|  0  |  1  |  1  |
The SHM segment is private (mode 0600). This is the fixed default for
clock units 0 and 1; clock units >1 are mode 0666 unless this bit is set
for the specific unit.
|1-31 |  -  |  -  | _reserved -- do not use_
|=============================================================

== Driver Options

+unit+ 'number'::
  The driver unit number, defaulting to 0. Used as a distinguishing
  suffix in the IPC unit name.
+time1+ 'time'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
  with default 0.0.
+time2+ 'time'::
   Maximum allowed difference between remote and local clock, in seconds.
   Values <1.0 or >86400.0 are ignored, and the default value of 4 h
   (14400 s) is used instead. See also flag 1.
+stratum+ 'number'::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.
+refid+ 'string'::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one to
  four characters, with default +SHM+.
+flag1 {0 | 1}+::
   _Check_ the difference limit check if set. _Skip_ the difference limit
   if not set (default).  There is really no need for this flag, just let
   the upper level logic prune out falsetickers.  NOTE:  this flag is
   the opposite of flag1 in NTP Classic.
+flag2 {0 | 1}+::
   Not used by this driver.
+flag3 {0 | 1}+::
   Not used by this driver.
+flag4 {0 | 1}+::
   If flag4 is set, clockstats records will be written when the driver is
   polled.
+subtype+::
   Not used by this driver.
+mode+::
   Can be used to set private mode
+path+ 'filename'::
  Not used by this driver.
+ppspath+ 'filename'::
  Not used by this driver.
+baud+ 'number'::
  Not used by this driver.

== GPSD Configuration Example

The most common use of this driver is to get samples from a
https://gpsd.io/[_gpsd_] instance.  _GPSD_ knows how to talk to many GPS
devices.  _GPSD_ will provide one or more SHM clocks depending on its
configuration.

For a GPS receiver with a pulse-per-second (PPS) connected to the host, there
will be one SHM clock for the serial data stream only and another SHM clock
with the PPS timing (when available):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
refclock shm unit 0 refid GPS
refclock shm unit 1 prefer refid PPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that there may be additional SHM clocks.  For example, the PPS might be
on +unit 2+.

The ntpd default minpoll is 6, and can be set as low as 0.  Changing
minpoll to 3, 2, 1 or maybe even as low as 0, may reduce your PPS jitter
by over a factor of 4.

Any change will require several hours for ntpd to converge with the new
settings.  Use ntpviz to find the best poll interval for your system.

The value that yields the lowest jitter may not be the one that yields
the best offset.

== Public vs. Private SHM segments

The driver attempts to create a shared memory segment with an
identifier depending on the unit number. Unix creates a shared memory
segment with a key value of \0x4E545030+_u_, where _u_ is again the
clock unit. (This value could be hex-decoded as \'NTP0', \'NTP1',...,
with funny characters for units > 9.)

Public access means a permission set of 0666, while private access
creates the mapping with a permission set of 0600.

ntpd is started as root on most POSIX-like operating systems and uses
the setuid/setgid system API to run under reduced rights once the
initial setup of the process is done. One consequence out of this is
that the allocation of SHM segments must be done early during the clock
setup. The actual polling of the clock is done as the run-time user;
deferring the creation of the SHM segment to this point will create an
SHM segment owned by the runtime-user account. The internal structure of
ntpd does not permit the use of a refclock option if this is to be avoided;
this is the reason why a mode bit is used for the configuration of a
public segment.
