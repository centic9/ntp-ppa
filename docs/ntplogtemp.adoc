P is for patching.

// This is preserved in case we ever want the historical flavor again.
// The baby panda was scanned at University College London and used as a
// FAX test image for a demonstration of the DARPA Atlantic SATNET Program
// and the first transatlantic Internet connection in 1978. The computing
// system used for that demonstration was called the
// {millshome}database/papers/fuzz.ps[Fuzzball]. As
// it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation
// and the first to use a predecessor of NTP in regular operation. The
// image was widely copied and used for testing purpose throughout much of
// the 1980s.
