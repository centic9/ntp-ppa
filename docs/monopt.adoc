[[intro]]
== Naming Conventions

The +ntpd+ daemon includes a comprehensive monitoring facility which
collects statistical data of various types and writes the data to
files associated with each type at defined events or intervals. The
files associated with a particular type are collectively called the
generation file set for that type. The files in the file set are the
members of that set.

File sets have names specific to the type and generation epoch. The
names are constructed from three concatenated elements _prefix_,
_filename_ and _suffix_:

_prefix_::
  The directory path specified in the +statsdir+ command.
_name_::
  The name specified by the +file+ option of the +filegen+ command.
_suffix_::
  A string of elements beginning with . (dot) followed by a number of
  elements depending on the file set type.

There is a visualization tool, link:ntpviz.html[ntpviz], which assists
in making sense of statistics files.
