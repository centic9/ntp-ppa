# Adjust for your needs and install as /etc/logrotate.d/ntpd
# This rotates monthly and kicks ntpd to start using the new file.
# It inherits dateext and compress from /etc/logrotate.conf

# If you are using SELinux, you will have to do something like:
#  cd /etc/logrotate.d/
#  sudo chcon --ref syslog ntpd
# That may not work if selinux is not active.  ????
# ls -Z will show the results
