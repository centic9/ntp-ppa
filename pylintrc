# NTPsec configuration for pylintrc

# NTPsec does not try to conform to pylint, but pylint can be useful
# to find things like unused variables, missing docstrings, undefined
# variables, unused imports, etc.
# 
# The whitespace checker in pylint conflicts with that in pycodestyle.
# pycodestyle replaces pep8 for checking PEP8 conformity.
# 
# Use pylint as an advisory tool, not as a blunt instrument.
