To create the RPM directory structure, run rpmdev-setuptree.  This creates all
the required directories.  Place the ntpsec.spec file in the SPECS directory
and download the current tarball file to the SOURCES directory.  You do not
need to extract the files.  RPM does this automatically.  From the rpmbuild
root directory, run "rpmbuild -ba SPECS/ntpsec.spec".  This will extract the
code and attempt to run the waf configure, build, and install steps.
