= README file for directory attic/ =

This is a dusty attic containing code we have not quite decided to
discard and chunks of code that may be useful is exploring performance
or corner cases.  Programs in it are not installed by default. Not much
documentation, alas.  Read the header comments.

calc_tickadj::	Calculates "optimal" value for tick given ntp.drift file
		Tested: 20160226

digest-find.c::	Hack to see if various digests are supported by OpenSSL

digest-timing.c:: Hack to measure execution times for various digests
		and key lengths

clocks::	Hack to measure properties of system clocks.

random::	Hack to measure timings of random(), RAND_bytes(), and
		RAND_priv_bytes().

kern.c:: 	Header comment from deep in the mists of past time says:
		"This program simulates a first-order, type-II
		phase-lock loop using actual code segments from
		modified kernel distributions for SunOS, Ultrix and
		OSF/1 kernels. These segments do not use any licensed
		code."  Anybody who has a clue *why* it is doing this
		and what it's supposed to be used for should explain
		it to us, please.

ntpdate::	Wrapper script to maintain compatibility. Maps options
		to ntpdig and calls it.
		Tested: 20160226

ntpver::	Simple script using ntpq to print out the suite version.
		Tested: 20160226

sht.c::		Test program for shared memory refclock.
