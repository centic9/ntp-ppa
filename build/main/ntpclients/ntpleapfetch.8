.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\f(CRntpleapfetch\fP will validate the file currently on the local system and
if necessary, update leap second definition file.
.sp
Ordinarily, the file is found using the "leapfile" directive in
\fIntp.conf(5)\fP. However, an alternate location can be specified on the
command line.
.sp
If the file does not exist, is not valid, has expired, or is expiring
soon, a new copy will be downloaded. If the new copy validates, it is
installed and NTP is (optionally) restarted.
.sp
If the current file is acceptable, no download or restart occurs.
.sp
\-c can also be used to invoke another script to perform administrative
functions, e.g. to copy the file to other local systems.
.sp
This can be run as a cron job. As the file is rarely updated, and leap
seconds are announced at least one month in advance (usually longer), it
need not be run more frequently than about once every three weeks.
.sp
For cron\-friendly behavior, define CRONJOB=1 in the crontab.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-4\fP
.RS 4
Use only IPv4 addresses for DNS name resolution. This option must not
appear in combination with \f(CR\-6\fP.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-6\fP
.RS 4
Use only IPv6 addresses for DNS name resolution. This option must not
appear in combination with \f(CR\-4\fP.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-c\fP
.RS 4
Command to restart ntpd after installing a new file. Without such a
command, ntpd checks the file daily.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-e\fP \fIexpiry\fP
.RS 4
Refresh the leapfile this long before it expires.
.sp
Specify how long before expiration the file is to be refreshed. Units
are required, e.g. "\-e 60 days". Note that larger values imply more
frequent refreshes.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-f\fP \fIconfig\fP
.RS 4
Location of the ntp.conf file.
.sp
Specify location of ntp.conf, which defaults to \f(CR/etc/ntp.conf\fP.  It is read
to make sure the "leapfile" directive is present and to determine the default
path to the leapfile.
