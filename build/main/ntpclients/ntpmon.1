.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This program is a real\-time status monitor for NTP.  It presents the
same information as the \fIpeers\fP, \fImrulist\fP, \fIrv\fP, and \fIcv\fP commands of
ntpq(1), but using a split\-window display that also includes a
status summary bar, and updates at intervals guaranteed to show status
changes almost as soon as they occur.
.sp
(Specifically, the display begins updating once per second and
adjusts itself to poll at twice the frequency of the shortest
polling interval reported in the last peers response.)
.sp
The status bar includes the version string of the server being
watched, the (local) time at which it was last updated, and the
current query interval in parens following the date.
.sp
There is a detail\-display mode that dumps full information about a
single selected peer in a tabular format that makes it relatively easy
to see changing values. However, note that a default\-sized terminal
emulator window (usually 25 lines) doesn\(cqt have enough room for the
clock variables portion. The only fix for this is to resize your
terminal.
.sp
^C cleanly terminates the program. Any keystroke will trigger a poll
and update. A few single\-keystroke commands are also interpreted as
commands.
.sp
If no hostname is specified on the command line, localhost is monitored.

.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
.sp
When run in a terminal that does not allow UTF\-8 ntpmon will downgrade
its unit display to a non\-unicode version. ntpmon has to interact with
the curses and locale libraries, which prevents it from forcing the use
of UTF\-8.
.sp
When querying a version of ntpd older than NTPsec 0.9.6, \f(CRntpmon\fP will
appear to hang when monitoring hosts with extremely long MRU lists \-
in particular, public pool hosts. Correct behavior requires a Mode 6
protocol extension not yet present in those versions.
.sp
Even with this extension, monitoring a sufficiently high\-traffic
server sometimes fails.
.sp
When using the \-u option, very old xterms may fail to render &mu;
correctly.  If this happens, be sure your xterm is started with the \-u8
option, or the \fIutf8\fP resource\(aq, and that your console font contains
the UTF\-8 &mu; character.  Also confirm your LANG environment variable is
set to a UTF\-8 language, like this: "export LANG=en_US.utf8".
.sp
Timestamp interpretation in this program is likely to fail in flaky
ways if the local system clock has not already been approximately
synchronized to UTC. Querying a server based in a different
NTP era than the current one is especially likely to fail.
.sp
This program will behave in apparently buggy and only semi\-predictable
ways when fetching MRU lists from \fIany\fP server with sufficiently high
traffic.
.sp
The problem is fundamental. The Mode 6 protocol can\(cqt ship (and your
client cannot accept) MRU records as fast as the daemon accepts
incoming traffic. Under these circumstances, the daemon will
repeatedly fail to ship an entire report, leading to long
hangs as your client repeatedly re\-sends the request. Eventually the
Mode 6 client library will throw an error indicating that a maximum
number of restarts has been exceeded.
.sp
To avoid this problem, avoid monitoring over links that don\(cqt have
enough capacity to handle the monitored server\(cqs \fIentire\fP NTP load.
