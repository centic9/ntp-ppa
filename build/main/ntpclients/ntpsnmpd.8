.SH "NAME"
ntpsnmpd \- NTP Simple Network Management Protocol sub\-agent
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRntpsnmpd\fP [\f(CR\-nxdDlhV\fP] [ntp host]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\f(CR[experimental]\fP
.sp
\f(CRntpsnmpd\fP is an AgentX Simple Network Management Protocol sub\-agent.
.sp
It functions as a bridge between the Mode 6 protocol used for Network
Time Protocol monitoring, and an SNMP master agent. The user must have
running NTP and SNMP daemons for ntpsnmpd to work.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-c\fP filename, \f(CR\-\-configfile\fP=filename
.RS 4

.SH "KNOWN LIMITATIONS"
.sp
This program is still experimental in nature. Parts of the AgentX standard
are not yet fully implemented, logging not fleshed out yet, some options
missing, etc.
.SH "KNOWN DEVIATIONS FROM RFC 5907"
.sp
The ntpEntStatusEntityUptime OID specifies a bizarre time format. This
does not match what the SNMP tools expect to see from a TimeTicks variable.
Instead the daemon returns a normal TimeTicks value.
.sp
The ntpEntNotifConfigChanged trap is left unimplemented. This is because
there currently is no way to implement what it wants, and it demands alerts
regarding changes that are not part of NTP\(cqs jurisdiction.
.sp
The ntpEntTimeResolution OID currently uses data from the sys_fuzz variable
as the base for it\(cqs calculations. It is by no means certain that this is
the correct choice, and the returned data should be taken with scepticism.
.sp
The ntpEntStatPktModeTable is unimplemented due to not currently having a
data source.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
Always returns 0.
