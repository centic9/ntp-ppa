.SH "NAME"
ntpfrob \- frob the clock hardware
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
ntpfrob [\-A] [\-b \fIbump\fR] [\-a \fItick\fR] [\-p \fIppsdev\fR] [\-c] [\-e] [\-r] [\-?] [\-h]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The ntpfrob program frobs the local clock hardware\&. It collects several small diagnostic functions into a set that will differ depending on your platform and underlying system calls\&. Portions of it formerly traveled as tickadj and some undocumented small utilities\&.
.SH "COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
.PP
\-a \fItick\fR
.RS 4
Set the kernel variable
tick
to the value
\fItick\fR
specifies\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A
.RS 4
Display the kernel variable
tick\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b \fIbump\fR
.RS 4
Bump the clock by a specified number of microseconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
Compute and display clock jitter\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
display values extracted via adjtimex(2)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 4
display values extracted via adjtimex(2) forcibly including PPS\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
Measure clock precision\&.
.RE
.PP
\-j
.RS 4
Generate a report in self\-describing JSON\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIppsdev\fR
.RS 4
Look for PPS pulses on a specified device
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Raw mode\&. Only applies to the jitter mode, and means the raw clock samples should be emitted to stdout for post analysis\&.
.RE
.PP
\-?
.RS 4
Print usage and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Print usage and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Print the version string and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "USAGE"
.sp
Documentation for some of these functions is scanty; this is a problem inherited from ancient days along with their code\&. If you suspect you may need to use them, reading the source code may be wise\&. If you believe you understand the code in more detail than any of these descriptions, please explain it to the NTPsec maintainers\&.
.sp
Normally this tool reports in an eyeball\-friendly unstructured text format\&. With the \-j option (where applicable) it reports JSON records\&. Note that the \-j option should be given before any mode option\&.
.sp
The reporting formats of this tool should be considered unstable; they may change as diagnostics are added or improved\&. JSON reports will be kept forward\-compatible through changes\&.
.SS "Clock tick adjustment"
.sp
The \-A function reads your clock\(cqs tick rate in microseconds\&. The \-a function sets it\&. Both rely on the adjtimex(2) system call\&. This mode finishes by reporting the tick value and (if available) the tick adjustment value\&.
.sp
The \-j option applies to this mode\&.
.sp
Tweaking your tick rate is almost never necessary on hardware new enough to have a fully POSIX\&.1\-2001\-conformant Unix\&.
.SS "Clock bump"
.sp
Sometimes it is diagnostically interesting to perturb your clock to watch how ntpd responds and makes corrections\&. This option does that\&.
.SS "Clock jitter measurement"
.sp
The \-c option can be used to determine the timing jitter due to the operating system in a gettimeofday() call\&. For most systems, the dominant contribution to the jitter budget is the period of the hardware interrupt, usually in the range between 10 us and 1 ms\&. For those systems with microsecond counters, the jitter is dominated only by the operating system\&.
.sp
The \-j option applies to this mode\&. With the \-r option, write the raw, unsorted clock samples to standard output for post\-analysis\&. All but the last \-j or \-r option before the \-c mode flag is ignored\&.
.SS "Pulse\-per\-second check"
.sp
The \-p option shows whether the PPS\-API (RFC 2783 kernel PPS interface) finds PPS on a specified device\&.
.SS "Measure clock precision"
.sp
The \-e option measure the resolution of the system clock, watching how the current time changes as we read it repeatedly\&.
.sp
The \-j option applies to this mode\&.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.PP
0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
.RS 4
Successful program execution\&.
.RE
.PP
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
.RS 4
The operation failed or the command invocation was not valid\&.
.RE
