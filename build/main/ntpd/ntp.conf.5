.SH "NAME"
ntp.conf \- Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon configuration file format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
/etc/ntp\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The ntp\&.conf configuration file is read at initial startup by the ntpd(8) daemon in order to specify the synchronization sources, modes, and other related information\&. Usually, it is installed in the /etc directory, but could be installed elsewhere (see the daemon\(cqs \-c command line option)\&.
.sp
The file format is similar to other UNIX configuration files\&. Comments begin with a \(oq#\(cq character and extend to the end of the line; blank lines are ignored\&. Configuration commands consist of an initial keyword followed by a list of arguments, some of which may be optional, separated by whitespace\&. Commands may not be continued over multiple lines\&. Arguments may be host names, host addresses written in numeric, dotted\-quad form, integers, floating point numbers (when specifying times in seconds) and text strings\&.
.sp
Configuration files may have inclusion lines\&. The syntax is includefile followed by whitespace followed by a file or directory name\&. The configuration is evaluated as though the text of the file \- or all files of the directory with the extension "\&.conf" \- were textually spliced in at the point of the include\&. Relative paths will work, even when the \-c option changes the config directory root\&.
.sp
The rest of this page describes the configuration and control options\&. The "Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up an NTP Subnet" page (available as part of the HTML documentation provided under /usr/share/doc/ntp) contains an extended discussion of these options\&. In addition to the discussion of general \fIConfiguration Options\fR, there are sections describing the following supported functionality and the options used to control it:

Miscellaneous Options
.RE
.sp
Following these is a section describing \fIMiscellaneous Options\fR\&. While there is a rich set of options available, the only required option is one or more pool, server, peer, or broadcast commands\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION SUPPORT"
.sp
Following is a description of the configuration commands in NTPv4\&. There are two classes of commands, association commands that configure a persistent association with a remote server or peer or reference clock, and auxiliary commands that specify environment variables that control various related operations\&.
.SS "Association Commands"
.sp
Only those options applicable to each command are listed below\&. Use of options not listed may not be caught as an error, but may result in some weird and even destructive behavior\&.
.sp
In contexts where a host name is expected, a \-4 or \-\-ipv4 qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a \-6 or \-\-ipv6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace\&.
.sp
In these commands, an \fIaddress\fR can be any of (a) an IPV4 address in a\&.b\&.c\&.d format, (b) an IPV6 address in [a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h] format, (c) a link\-local IPV6 address with an interface specified in [a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h]%device format, or (d) a DNS hostname\&.
.sp
pool \fIaddress\fR [burst] [iburst] [version \fIversion\fR] [prefer] [minpoll \fIminpoll\fR] [maxpoll \fImaxpoll\fR] [preempt]
.sp
server \fIaddress\fR [key \fIkey\fR] [burst] [iburst] [version \fIversion\fR] [prefer] [minpoll \fIminpoll\fR] [maxpoll \fImaxpoll\fR]
.sp
peer \fIaddress\fR [key \fIkey\fR] [version \fIversion\fR] [prefer] [minpoll \fIminpoll\fR] [maxpoll \fImaxpoll\fR]
.PP
unpeer [\fIaddress\fR | \fIassocid\fR | clock \fIclocktype\fR [unit \fIunitnum\fR]]
.RS 4
These four commands specify the time server name or address to be used and the mode in which to operate\&. The
\fIaddress\fR
can be either a DNS name or an IP address in dotted\-quad notation\&. If it is a refclock, it can be
clock
followed by a type\-unit pair as in the
refclock
directive; a missing unit clause is interpreted as unit 0\&.
.RE
.PP
pool
.RS 4
For server addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode association with a number of remote servers\&. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock\&.
.RE
.PP
server
.RS 4
For server addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode association with the specified remote server or local radio clock\&. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock\&.
.RE
.PP
peer
.RS 4
NTP peer mode has been removed for security reasons\&. peer is now just an alias for the server keyword\&. See above\&.
.RE
.PP
unpeer
.RS 4
This command removes a previously configured association\&. An address or association ID can be used to identify the association\&. Either an IP address or DNS name can be used\&. This command is most useful when supplied via
ntpq
runtime configuration commands
config
and
config\-from\-file\&.
.RE
.SS "Association Options"
.PP
bias
.RS 4
Add the command argument, a floating\-point value in seconds, to the time offset () computed for this server; this may be useful if you are a client on a network connection such as an ADSL line where there is a predictable asymmetry between upstream and downstream flight times\&. One way you might see this is if you use a fixed set of others and one has a stable offset that is an outlier from the others; in that case, you might want to use
bias
to compensate out the offset\&.
.RE
.PP
burst
.RS 4
When the server is reachable, send a burst of eight packets instead of the usual one\&. The packet spacing is normally 2 s; however, the spacing between the first and second packets can be changed with the calldelay command to allow additional time for a modem or ISDN call to complete; this is designed to improve timekeeping quality with the
server
command\&.
.RE
.PP
iburst
.RS 4
When the server is unreachable, send a burst of six packets instead of the usual one\&. The packet spacing is normally 2 s; however, the spacing between the first and second packets can be changed with the calldelay command to allow additional time for a modem or ISDN call to complete; this is designed to speed the initial synchronization acquisition with the
server
command, and when ntpd(8) is started with the
\-q
option\&.
.RE
.PP
key \fIkey\fR
.RS 4
All packets sent to and received from the server or peer are to include authentication fields encrypted using the specified
\fIkey\fR
identifier with values from 1 to 65535, inclusive\&. The default is to include no encryption field\&.
.RE
.PP
minpoll \fIminpoll\fR, maxpoll \fImaxpoll\fR
.RS 4
These options specify the minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP messages, as a power of 2 in seconds\&. The maximum poll interval defaults to 10 (1,024 s), but can be increased by the
\fImaxpoll\fR
option to an upper limit of 17 (36\&.4 h)\&. The minimum poll interval defaults to 6 (64 s), but can be decreased by the
\fIminpoll\fR
option to a lower limit of 0 (1 s)\&.
.RE
.PP
mode \fIoption\fR
.RS 4
Pass the
option
to a reference clock driver\&. This option is valid only with refclock addresses\&.
.RE
.PP
noselect
.RS 4
Marks the server as unused, except for display purposes\&. The server is discarded by the selection algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
prefer
.RS 4
Marks the server as preferred\&. All other things being equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization among a set of correctly operating hosts\&. See the "Mitigation Rules and the prefer Keyword" page for further information\&.
.RE
.PP
true
.RS 4
Mark the association to assume truechimer status; that is, always survive the selection and clustering algorithms\&. This option can be used with any association but is most useful for reference clocks with large jitter on the serial port and precision pulse\-per\-second (PPS) signals\&. Caution: this option defeats the algorithms designed to cast out falsetickers and can allow these sources to set the system clock\&. This option is valid only with the
server
command\&.
.RE
.PP
version \fIversion\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the version number to be used for outgoing NTP packets\&. Versions 1\-4 are the choices, with version 4 the default\&.
.RE
.SS "Association Auxiliary Commands"
.PP
mdnstries \fInumber\fR
.RS 4
If we are participating in mDNS, after we have synched for the first time we attempt to register with the mDNS system\&. If that registration attempt fails, we try again at one minute intervals for up to
\fInumber\fR
times\&. After all,
ntpd
may be starting before mDNS\&. The default value for
mdnstries
is 5\&.
.RE
.SS "Authentication Commands"
.sp
The following declarations control MAC authentication:
.PP
controlkey \fIkey\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the key identifier to use with the ntpq(1) utility, which uses the standard protocol defined in RFC 5905\&. The
\fIkey\fR
argument is the key identifier for a trusted key, where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,535, inclusive\&.
.RE
.PP
keys \fIkeyfile\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the complete path and location of the key file containing the keys and key identifiers used by ntpd(8), and ntpq(1) when operating with symmetric\-key cryptography\&. This is the same operation as the
\-k
command line option\&.
.RE
.PP
trustedkey \fIkey\&...\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the key identifiers which are trusted for the purposes of authenticating peers with symmetric key cryptography, as well as keys used by the ntpq(1) program\&. Multiple keys on the same line should be separated by spaces\&. Key ranges can be specified as (first \&... last)\&. The spaces around the \&... are necessary\&. Multiple
trustedkey
lines are supported and trusted keys can also be specified on the command line\&.
.RE
.sp
The MAC authentication procedures require that both the local and remote servers share the same key and key identifier for this purpose, although different keys can be used with different servers\&. The \fIkey\fR arguments are 32\-bit unsigned integers with values from 1 to 65,535\&.
.SS "NTS Commands"
.sp
The following command controls NTS authentication\&. It overrides normal TLS protocol negotiation, which is not usually necessary\&.
.sp
nts [enable|disable] [mintls \fIversion\fR] [maxtls \fIversion\fR] [tlsciphersuites \fIname\fR]
.sp
The options are as follows:
.PP
cert \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Present the certificate in
\fIfile\fR
as our certificate\&.
.RE
.PP
key \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Read the private key to our certificate from
\fIfile\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
ca \fIlocation\fR
.RS 4
Use the file, or directory, specified by
\fIlocation\fR
to validate NTS\-KE server certificates instead of the system default root certificates\&. If a directory is specified, it must have files named with their hash, as created by
openssl rehash\&.
.RE
.PP
cookie \fIlocation\fR
.RS 4
Use the file (or directory) specified by
\fIlocation\fR
to store the keys used to make and decode cookies\&. The default is
\fI/var/lib/ntp/nts\-keys\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
enable
.RS 4
Enable NTS\-KE server\&. When enabled,
cert
and
key
are required\&.
.RE
.PP
disable
.RS 4
Disable NTS\-KE server\&.
.RE
.PP
mintls \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Set the lowest allowable TLS version to negotiate\&. Will be useful in the wake of a TLS compromise\&. Reasonable values are
\fITLS1\&.3\fR
if your system supports it\&. TLS 1\&.3 was first supported in OpenSSL version 1\&.1\&.1\&.
.RE
.PP
maxtls \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Set the highest allowable TLS version to negotiate\&. By setting
mintls
and
maxtls
equal, you can force the TLS version for testing\&. Format is as for
mintls\&.
.RE
.PP
tlsciphersuites \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
An OpenSSL ciphersuite list to configure the allowed ciphersuites for TLS 1\&.3\&. A single NULL cipher disables encryption and use of certificates\&.
.RE
.PP
aead \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Specify the crypto algorithm to be used on the wire\&. The choices come from RFC 5297\&. The only options supported are AES_SIV_CMAC_256, AES_SIV_CMAC_384, and AES_SIV_CMAC_512\&. This slot is dual use\&. It is the server default if the remote client doesn\(cqt request a valid choice and it is also the preference passed to the remote client if the server command doesn\(cqt specify a preference\&. The default is AES_SIV_CMAC_256\&.
.RE
.sp
The following options of the server command configure NTS (as a client)\&.
.PP
nts
.RS 4
Use Network Time Security (NTS) for authentication\&. Normally, this is all you have to do to activate the client side of NTS\&.

The hostname following the
server
command is used as the address of the NTS key exchange server (NTS\-KE) rather than the address of a NTP server\&. The NTS\-KE exchange defaults to using the same IP address for the NTP server\&.

Note that the
server
hostname must match the name on the NTS\-KE server\(cqs certificate\&.
.RE
.PP
noval
.RS 4
Do not validate the server certificate\&.
.RE
.PP
ca \fIlocation\fR
.RS 4
Use the file, or directory, specified by
\fIlocation\fR
to validate the NTS\-KE server certificate, overriding the site default\&. Do not use any other CA\&. If a directory is specified, it must have files named with their hash, as created by
openssl rehash\&.
.RE
.PP
aead \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Specify the preferred crypto algorithm to be used on the wire\&. The only options supported are AES_SIV_CMAC_256, AES_SIV_CMAC_384, and AES_SIV_CMAC_512\&. The server may ignore the request\&. See the
aead
option above\&.

The same
aead
algorithms are also used to encrypt cookies\&. The default is AES_SIV_CMAC_256\&. There is no config file option to change it, but you can change it by editing the saved cookie key file, probably
\fI/var/lib/ntp/nts\-keys\fR\&. Adjust the
\fIL:\fR
slot to be 48 or 64 and adjust the
\fII:\fR
slots to have the right number of bytes\&. Then restart the server\&. (All old cookies held by clients will be rejected so their next 8 NTP requests will be ignored\&. They should recover by retrying NTS\-KE to get fresh cookies\&.)
.RE
.SH "MONITORING SUPPORT"
.sp
ntpd(8) includes a comprehensive monitoring facility suitable for continuous, long term recording of server and client timekeeping performance\&. See the statistics command below for a listing and example of each type of statistics currently supported\&. Statistic files are managed using file generation sets and scripts in the \&./scripts directory of this distribution\&. Using these facilities and UNIX cron(8) jobs, the data can be automatically summarized and archived for retrospective analysis\&.

.SH "ACCESS CONTROL SUPPORT"
.sp
The ntpd(8) daemon implements a general purpose address/mask based restriction list\&. The list contains address/match entries sorted first by increasing address values and then by increasing mask values\&. A match occurs when the bitwise AND of the mask and the packet source address is equal to the bitwise AND of the mask and address in the list\&. The list is searched in order with the last match found defining the restriction flags associated with the entry\&. Additional information and examples can be found in the "Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up a NTP Subnet" page (available as part of the HTML documentation)\&.
.sp
The restriction facility was implemented in conformance with the access policies for the original NSFnet backbone time servers\&. Later the facility was expanded to deflect cryptographic and clogging attacks\&. While this facility may be useful for keeping unwanted or broken or malicious clients from congesting innocent servers, it should not be considered an alternative to the NTP authentication facilities\&. Source address based restrictions are easily circumvented by a determined cracker\&.
.sp
Clients can be denied service because they are explicitly included in the restrict list created by the restrict command or implicitly as the result of cryptographic or rate limit violations\&. Cryptographic violations include certificate or identity verification failures; rate limit violations generally result from defective NTP implementations that send packets at abusive rates\&. Some violations cause denied service only for the offending packet, others cause denied service for a timed period and others cause the denied service for an indefinite period\&. When a client or network is denied access for an indefinite period, the only way at present to remove the restrictions is by restarting the server\&.
.SS "The Kiss\-of\-Death Packet"
.sp
Ordinarily, packets denied service are simply dropped with no further action except incrementing statistics counters\&. Sometimes a more proactive response is needed, such as a server message that explicitly requests the client to stop sending and leave a message for the system operator\&. A special packet format has been created for this purpose called the "kiss\-of\-death" (KoD) packet\&. KoD packets have the leap bits set unsynchronized and stratum set to zero and the reference identifier field set to a four\-byte ASCII code\&. If the noserve or notrust flag of the matching restrict list entry is set, the code is "DENY"; if the limited flag is set and the rate limit is exceeded, the code is "RATE"\&. Finally, if a cryptographic violation occurs, the code is "CRYP"\&.
.sp
A client receiving a KoD performs a set of sanity checks to minimize security exposure, then updates the stratum and reference identifier peer variables, sets the access denied (BOGON4) bit in the peer flash variable and sends a message to the log\&. As long as the BOGON4 bit is set, the client will send no further packets to the server\&. The only way at present to recover from this condition is to restart the protocol at both the client and server\&. This happens automatically at the client when the association times out\&. It will happen at the server only if the server operator cooperates\&.

The
\fIaddress\fR
argument expressed in dotted\-quad (for IPv4) or :\-delimited (for IPv6) form is the address of a host or network\&. Alternatively, the
\fIaddress\fR
argument can be a valid host DNS name\&. The
\fImask\fR
argument expressed in IPv4 or IPv6 numeric address form defaults to all mask bits on, meaning that the
\fIaddress\fR
is treated as the address of an individual host\&. Instead of an explicit
\fImask\fR, the
\fIaddress/cidr\fR
may be specified in CIDR notation\&. A default entry (address
0\&.0\&.0\&.0, mask
0\&.0\&.0\&.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the list\&. Note that text string
\fIdefault\fR, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry\&. In the current implementation,
\fIflag\fR
always restricts access, i\&.e\&., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given\&. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant\&.

One or more of the following flags may be specified:

time1 \fIsec\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a constant to be added to the time offset produced by the driver, a fixed\-point decimal number in seconds\&. Each "g" on the end of the constant adds the number of seconds in a 10\-bit GPS era; each "G" adds the number of seconds in a 13\-bit GPS era\&. This is used as a calibration constant to adjust the nominal time offset of a particular clock to agree with an external standard, such as a precision PPS signal\&. It also provides a way to correct a systematic error or bias due to era wraparound from a GPS device, serial port or operating system latencies, different cable lengths or receiver internal delay\&. The specified offset is in addition to the propagation delay provided by other means, such as internal DIP switches\&. Where a calibration for an individual system and driver is available, an approximate correction is noted in the driver documentation pages\&. Note: To facilitate calibration when more than one radio clock or PPS signal is supported, a special calibration feature is available\&. It takes the form of an argument to the
enable
command described in "Miscellaneous Options" page and operates as described in the "Reference Clock Drivers" page\&.

driftfile \fIdriftfile\fR
.RS 4
This command specifies the complete path and name of the file used to record the frequency of the local clock oscillator; this is the same operation as the
\-f
command line option\&. If the file exists, it is read at startup to set the initial frequency and then updated once per hour with the current frequency computed by the daemon\&. If the file name is specified, but the file itself does not exist,
ntpd
starts with an initial frequency of zero and creates the file when writing it for the first time\&. If this command is not given, the daemon will always start with an initial frequency of zero\&.
.sp
The file format consists of a single line containing a single floating point number, which records the frequency offset measured in parts\-per\-million (PPM)\&. The file is updated by first writing the current drift value into a temporary file and then renaming this file to replace the old version; this implies that ntpd(8) must have write permission for the directory the drift file is located in, and that file system links, symbolic or otherwise, should be avoided\&.

keywords can be prefixed with \(oq=\(cq, \(oq+\(cq and \(oq\-\(cq, where \(oq=\(cq sets the syslog(3) priority mask, \(oq+\(cq adds and \(oq\-\(cq removes messages\&. syslog(3) messages can be controlled in four classes (clock,peer,sys and sync)\&. Within these classes four types of messages can be controlled: informational messages (info), event messages (events), statistics messages (statistics) and status messages (status)\&.
