= How-to for NTPsec hackers

Annoying but necessary legalese:

    By submitting patches to this project you agree to allow them to be
    redistributed under the project's license, according to the normal
    forms and usages of the open-source community.

If you want to learn more about the code internals, consult the
../devel/tour.adoc file.  This document is about development practices
and project conventions.

You may also find the articles at https://blog.ntpsec.org/
interesting.

== Choice of language

In order to reduce the complexity of maintenance and testing
due to multiple languages, we hold the set of allowed languages
to a minimum.

Time-critical code must be written in C. Use Python for any code that
is not time-critical, as this reduces line count and complexity (thus,
also, expected defect rates). If you need an NTP-specific C function
not available in Python, try to improve the libntpc extension
in ../libntp/pymodule.c to expose it.

The only scripting language allowed and supported other than Python is
POSIX sh (this is more restricted than bash!).  Python is preferred, as
it's easier to verify portability in Python than it is in sh.

Please read our C and Python guidelines carefully; they're not just
about style, they're serious measures to reduce defect rates.

== Inclusions from other projects

Git subtrees and submodules are clever but full of traps. Discussion
here:

https://medium.com/@porteneuve/mastering-git-submodules-34c65e940407
https://medium.com/@porteneuve/mastering-git-subtrees-943d29a798ec

These don't even touch the biggest issue, which is stable reproducible
builds.  For this reason, we use naive textual inclusion.

So far this has only been an issue with libaes_siv. If you notice
there's an inclusion not listed here, file an issue.

== C Guidelines

=== C API standards

The baseline C standard to write to is ISO/IEC 9899:1999, also known
as C99 (but see the following section on banned functions).  Note that
C99 is a coding standard, not an ABI standard, so it can happily
coexist with distributions that use C89 conventions.

You can download the C99 standard for free from here:
    http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf

You *may* use C11-style anonymous unions.

Only POSIX-1.2001/SUSv3 library functions should be used (a few
specific exceptions are noted below).  If a library function not
in that standard is required, then a wrapper function for backward
compatibility must be provided.

You can read POSIX-1.2001, with 2004 Corrigendum, online for free here:
    https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/toc.htm

You can see POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3, online for free here:
    https://web.archive.org/web/20190501135119/http://www.unix.org/version3/

POSIX threads *are* considered part of the standardized API, but their
use requires care.  The main part of ntpd assumes it is the only
thread.

One interesting area is msyslog.  The DNS thread doesn't call msyslog,
but that is historical.  In the old days, msyslog wasn't thread-safe.
That was impractical for NTS, so msyslog is thread safe as of 2019-Apr.

Beware of calling strerror() from non-main threads.  Use ntp_strerror_r()
into a buffer on the stack. (strerror_r() has an ambigious API.)

Similarly, use socktoa_r() and sockporttoa_r() and don't call lib_getbuf(),
refclock_name(), or exit().  [exit() calls the registered cleanup routines
and some of them call lib_getbuf() which will crash (again) when called
from a non-main thread.  So avoid exit() if you can, but use it if you
can't find a better way.]

Don't call get_systime() from non-main threads.


We support some cases where systems are not fully POSIX compliant.
This is an attempt to collect them.

  MacOS (?? or something) doesn't support timer_create(2).
  We work around that by using the older setitimer(2).
  POSIX.1-2008 marks getitimer() and setitimer() obsolete.


Here are the non-standardized APIs that may be used:

* Either ntp_adjtime() or the older BSD adjtime(2).

* Berkeley sockets and the IPv6 API defined in RFC 2493 and RFC 2553.

* getifaddrs(3) or an equivalent local API for iterating over the
  system's active UDP interfaces. However, the local details should be
  hidden as an implementation of the isc_interfaceiter.c functions,
  not called directly from the rest of the code.

* Local facilities for reading packet arrival timestamps out of the
  UDP packet layer.  See ntpd/ntp_packetstamp.c for details - if you
  add a local hack to do this, it needs to be sealed inside that module.

=== Banned functions

The following C99/POSIX functions are BANNED.  They are unsafe, tending to
cause buffer overruns and (all too often) exploitable security holes:

* strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat:  Use strlcpy and strlcat instead.
* sprintf, vsprintf: use snprintf and vsnprintf instead.
* In scanf and friends, the %s format without length limit is banned.
* strtok: use strtok_r() or unroll this into the obvious loop.
* gets: Use fgets instead.
* gmtime(), localtime(), asctime(), ctime(): use the reentrant *_r variants.
* tmpnam(): use mkstemp() or tmpfile() instead.

Do not rely on dirname() being reentrant, and assume it will modify
(truncate) its argument. The Linux version is re-entrant, but this
property is not portable.

In general, avoid functions that are non-reentrant.  When in doubt, see
http://www.unix.org/whitepapers/reentrant.html[Thread-safety and POSIX.1]

=== Banned features

All C files should be in plain US-ASCII encoding; do not use trigraphs.

=== Other interfaces to be avoided

Don't use gettimeofday(2).  While this is nominally POSIX, it is
deprecated and may be removed in the future.  Use clock_gettime(2)
instead.

Use pselect(2) rather than select(2), to avoid introducing struct
timeval.

In general, avoid introducing the type struct timeval into the code,
in favor of the higher-resolution struct timespec. Early on in
NTPsec's history, we found a bug introduced by poor data management
where these two time representations bumped into each other; we don't
want that to happen again. Thus, if you must refer to struct timeval due to
an external interface, move the data to/from a struct timespec as
close to that call site as possible.

=== Random numbers

There are 2 types of random numbers - pseudo-random and
cryptographically secure.  For cryptographically secure needs,
we use RAND_bytes() and RAND_priv_bytes() from OpenSSL.
The actual use is funneled through ntp_RAND_bytes() to
check the return code and crash if it doesn't work.
RAND_bytes() can fail if the system doesn't collect enough
entropy but we have never seen that happen yet.

For general purpose pseudo-randomness, we use random(3).  Note that
it only returns 31 bits.  It is much faster than RAND_bytes()

RAND_MAX on FreeBSD is 0xfffffffd.

Python also has 2 forms of randomness.  random is older.  secure
was added in Python 3.6.  We only use it in ntpkeygen.
Random isn't cryptographically secure.  secure is.

=== Other Packages

We depend on the host distro to provide OpenSSL.
NTS-KE (key exchange) requires TLSv1.3 or newer.
That means OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or newer.
Shared key authentication uses their crypto package.
We also use their RAND_bytes().

   Note that OpenSSL 1.0.1 is no longer supported.  2020-Feb-17
   Note that OpenSSL 1.1.0 is no longer supported.  2020-Mar-12

We also use waf, libaes_siv, libjsmn, and unity but we have local
copies rather than depending on the host distro to provide them.

=== Coding style and indentation

Dr. Dave Mills liked this code indented and formatted in a consistent way.
The file "dot.emacs" has the emacs C-mode indentation style that Dave
likes. It's a bit archaic, but we've stuck with it to preserve
continuity; you should, too.

*Do* always add the optional braces around if/for/while/do bodies.
It helps readability, staves off some subtle errors, and will be
helpful if the code is ever moved to https://golang.org/[Go].

A discussion about using uncrustify to mass convert all the C sources
to a more current indentation and format style is ongoing.  As it will
result in a coordinated flag day in ongoing development, it will be
carefully announced in the mailto:devel@ntpsec.org mailing list before
being merged and pushed.

=== Conventions for #ifdef guard names

Parts of this code are a thicket of C preprocessor conditionals.
In an attempt to make these halfway comprehensible, we use the
following conventions to distinguish classes of macro names:

ENABLE_*::
	Gates the code for an optional feature.  Set by a switch on
	the "waf configure" invocation.

GUARD_*::
	Symbols with the GUARD_ prefix are idempotency guards - that is,
	they're used to nullify inclusions of a header file
	after the first. They don't interact with the build system's
	configuration logic in any way at all.

HAVE_*_H::
	Guard symbol derived by configuration logic from checking
	for the presence of a system header.  For example, the symbol
	HAVE_SYS_FOOBAR_H gets defined only if waf configure detects
	the presence of sys/foobar.h in the system include directory.

HAVE_*::
	Without an H suffix, a HAVE symbol is set on the availability
	of a specified function in the system libraries.

NEED_*::
	Need symbols conditionalize porting hacks the need for which
	cannot be detected by checking for a system header or
	function, but instead have to be probed for by some ad-hoc
	test in waf configure.

OVERRIDE_*::
	Override a default for debugging purposes. These are values
	(buffer lengths and the like) which waf is not expected to
	override normally but which might need to be forced.

USE_*::
	Use symbols are set internally within other conditionals to
	gate use of sections of code that must be conditionally
	compiled depending on *combinations* of HAVE and NEED symbols.

=== Cross-platform portability

Do not bake in any assumptions about 32-vs-64-bit word size.  It is OK
to assume the code will never run on a 16-bit machine.  When in doubt,
and whenever possible, use the fixed-width integral types from
<stdint.h>.

You *may* assume twos-complement arithmetic.  The C Standards
committee has accepted a proposal to mandate twos complement in the
next revision beyond ISO/IEC 9899:2018.  Some of our code requires it.

You *may* assume that the compiler supports POSIX 64-bit integral types
(int64_t, uint64_t and friends) even if the target hardware is 32-bit.

Do not assume any particular endianness. When in doubt, use
htons()/htonl()/ntohs()/ntohl() and do your bit-bashing in network
(big-endian) byte order.

Do not assume anything about sign-bit interpretation in chars.  Target
machines may have either signed or unsigned characters.

Do not rely on assumptions about how structure or unions are padded.
Historically, the NTP code assumed self-alignment.  We're trying
to eliminate that assumption, but the work isn't finished.

Do not assume you can cast pointers to ints, or vice-versa.  While this
is true on effectively all modern hardware, the code runs on some
sufficiently old iron that this is not necessarily the case even if
the compiler and toolchain have been modernized.

== Python guidelines

You may assume Python 2 at 2.6 or later, or Python 3 at 3.3 or later.

Please read https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/[PEP 8] and use
that style.  The only PEP 8 style rule we relax is that you may
specify multiple module names in an import rather than going strictly
with one per line.  The point is to encourage you to group your import
declarations in informative ways.

You *must* write Python code to be 'polyglot', that can run
unaltered under 2 or 3.  Practices for doing so are documented in
detail at

http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/practical-python-porting/

Note that Python 3.x versions before 3.3 had sufficiently serious
backward-compatibility issues that trying to make them run is probably
doomed.  The first 3.x version under which our Python has been
extensively tested is 3.5.

Please check your Python code with Pyflakes.  If your code fails
a Pyflakes test, we probably will not merge it.

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes

Note: In the future, the Python baseline may be
https://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2015/04/stop-supporting-python26.html[changed
to 2.7].

== General notes

=== Build system

The build uses waf, replacing a huge ancient autoconf hairball that
caused many problems. The waf script is embedded in the top level of
the distribution; run "./waf --help" or consult INSTALL for basic
instructions.

Full waf documentation is at https://waf.io/

=== Naming conventions

Almost every binary and script we install has an "ntp" prefix on the name
because namespace pollution is rude. If you write a new tool that you
want us to install, follow this convention.

Generally, we favor "ntp" rather than "ntp-" for consistency and to
reduce the amount people have to type. Choose tastefully.

=== Well-tempered output

We are devotees of the Unix rule that programs should play nicely
with other programs.  We like output formats that are simple,
regular, and machine-parseable without ambiguity. The practical
goal to aim at, given our choice of scripting languages,
is to make writing script wrappers in Python easy.

There is more than one way to arrange this.  If you can design a
simple tabular output format, or something resembling an RFC 2822 header
that's easy for both human eyes and programs to parse, do that.
Besides being simple, formats like these are easily handled by either
Python or shell scripts.

Such simplicity is often difficult or impractical for heterogeneous
data that needs to be both grouped and labeled, so we have another
convention for those cases. Here it is:

[quote]
Wherever it is reasonable, tools that generate complex reports to
standard output should be able to emit two formats. The default can be
[a] relatively unstructured multiline text for human eyeballs. There
should also be a -j/--json option that emits a self-describing JSON
object.

You can read about JSON at https://www.json.org/

Be aware that if you present a tool design with a messy output format
and no JSON option, it is quite likely to be rejected.

Our preferred format for dates is RFC 3339 (a version of ISO 8601 for
UTC with some options frozen; full year required, medial T required,
explicit Zulu timezone). Local times should be expressed in ISO 8601,
always with the full 4-digit year.

=== Copyrights and licenses

Much of the historic code in this distribution is under the "NTP
License" resembling BSD-2-Clause.  Our favored licenses are
BSD-2-Clause for code and Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License
for documentation.

Please do *not* submit code under GPL or other licenses which place
conditions on derived works; we cannot accept such code.

It is your responsibility to make sure you have the necessary rights
to contribute a patch to the project.

Do not specify a year in a copyright statement.  Most of the existing
copyright statements already present in the project have been scrubbed
of the year.  There is no need to specify the year in a copyright
statement.  Several large legally sophisticated companies, include
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, are now publishing open
source code with copyright statements without a year.  We encourage
the larger open source community to emulate this.

The string "(c)" is legally meaningless.  Use the word "Copyright".

We use the SPDX convention for inclusion by reference.  You can read
about this at

      https://spdx.org/licenses

When you create a new file, mark it as follows as required:

------------------------------------------------
/* Copyright the NTPsec project contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause
 */
------------------------------------------------

For documentation:

------------------------------------------------
// Copyright the NTPsec project contributors
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
------------------------------------------------

Modify as needed for whatever comment syntax the language or markup uses.
Good places for these markings are at the end of an extended
header comment, or at the very top of the file.

When you modify a file, leave existing copyright markings in place -
especially all references to Dr. Dave Mills, to Mr. Harlan Stenn, and
to the Network Time Foundation.

You *may* add project copyright and replace the inline license
with an SPDX tag. For example:

------------------------------------------------
/* Copyright the NTPsec project contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: NTP
 */
------------------------------------------------

We recognize that occasionally a file may have changed so much that
the historic copyright is no longer appropriate, but such decisions
cannot be made casually. Discuss it with the project management
before moving.

=== Document what you do

When you change anything user-visible, you are expected to update the
relevant documentation *in the same commit*.  No exceptions.

Otherwise, we'd have to inflict long, tedious document reviews on
everybody. Nobody wants that.

=== Documentation format and structure

All our documentation is mastered in asciidoc.  That includes internal
documentation like this file. We do this because asciidoc is easy to
edit and gives us good options for rendering to multiple formats,
including both HTML and Unix manual pages

If you're going to write in anything else you need to have a good
reason, and the bar for "good" will be set high.  "I like Markdown",
in particular, does not qualify - Markdown doesn't have good enough table
support for our needs.  ReST does, but the hassle costs of supporting
two different master markups are too high.

If you must use non-ASCII characters, use UTF-8 and not Latin-1 or
any other encoding.  Best practice is to use XML character entities.

The NTP Classic documentation had a terrible problem with duplicative
documentation gradually diverging as the duplicates mutated and
bitrotted. Therefore one of our house rules is to have a *single point
of truth* for everything.

Accordingly, the way we handle pairs of manual and Web pages that
need to have the same content is to have both be thin wrappers around
a large common include file. These includes live in docs/includes
and are probably what you need to edit if you're updating anything
that appears on a man page.

All headers should be asymmetric Atx-style. Text wraps somewhere around
column 72 (forget semantic writing) and unless otherwise noted refer to
the January 2019 revision of the draft AsciiDoc Recommended
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[Practices].

=== Version number

We use a variant of three-part Semantic Versioning, of the form X.Y.Z.
X, Y, and Z are non-negative decimal integers.

X is the "major" version number.
Y is the "minor" version number.
Z is the "revision" number.

Each release will result in an incremented version number and the
version number string will be tagged into the git repository.

We have dropped even/odd minor version number stable/development
release semantics.  Development on NTPsec has been carefully
incremental with a strong emphasis on stabilty and correctness, such
that it turned out to be unneeded.

The first public release was version 0.9.0.
The first production and distribution ready release was 1.0.0.

We currently have no formal policies for the criteria for releases,
for the schedule of releases, and no formal policies for backporting
bugfixes.  Feel free to discuss it with project management.

Note that this is a different numbering system from NTP Classic. In
their A.B.C numbers, A was the protocol version, B was the major, and
C was the minor.  They also use release-candidate suffixes.

== Version string

Release builds have version strings of the form:

<X.Y.Z>[ <build-desc>]

Development builds have version strings of the form:

<X.Y.Z>+<# of commits since tag>-g<git short hash>[-dirty][ <build-desc>]

== Contribution workflow and conventions

Please work on one piece of conceptual work at a time.

Please make sure your code builds and passes the test suite before you
commit it, and especially before you push it.

Before starting significant work, propose it first in the
mailto:devel@ntpsec.org mailing list.  Other people may have
suggestions, will want to collaborate, and will wish to review your
code.

=== Git

We use Git as our distributed version control system.

If you ever get stuck or confused while using Git, please consult
https://ohshitgit.com/

=== GitLab.com

We use GitLab.com as our forge.

Our GitLab group is at https://gitlab.com/groups/NTPsec

Please use the issue tracker and the merge request process at GitLab.com.

If you wish, you can request to join the GitLab project team at
https://gitlab.com/groups/NTPsec/group_members and we will add you to the
team with Guest access; this will cause GitLab to send issue tracker
updates and pipeline updates to your email address.  You do not have
to formally be a member of the GitLab team to participate, contribute,
or send issues, patches, or merge requests.

Granting other levels of GitLab project team access is at the discretion
of the Project Manager, after consulting with the existing core team.
Generally, other levels of access will not be granted, as they are not
necessary to be a welcome and effective contributor.

=== Optional: Send patches by email

If you do not want to use GitLab pull requests, we welcome simple fix
and "drive-by" patches submitted by email.

Please create the patch with git format-patch.

If for some reason it is impossible for you to use git format-patch,
at least send context (-c) or unified (-u) diffs rather than the
default ed (-e) style, which is very brittle.

You can email your patch to mailto:devel@ntpsec.org if you are a member of
that mailing list or you can email your patch to
mailto:contact@ntpsec.org if you are not.

Please make sure your "From:" header in the email is correct, as that
is what will be used as the attribution of the commit.

The team member who merges your patch will use the git
parameter ---author from the email From header and the git parameter
--date from the email Date header.

We recommend you consult http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6802

For complex patches and contribution narratives, do please use GitLab.

== Commit comments

And please follow git conventions for change comments. That means your comment
should consist of:

* A summary line, never more than 69 characters long and ideally no more than
  50 characters long.  These numbers are set by the window sizes of various
  common web views of git repositories.

* Your summary line should be terse and imperative.  "Fix bug #666" "Add DWIM
  feature" and "Typo repair" are good summary lines.

* If your comment is longer than the summary line, separate it from
  the summary with a blank line.

* The remainder of your comment should be one or more paragraphs line-wrapped at
  72 characters - please do *not* enter entire paragraphs as single lines, it
  makes life more difficult for browsing tools and people viewing the output of
  git format-patch. Bulleted list items are also OK.

* In some cases it may be appropriate to end your summary line with a comma
  or ellipsis ("...") to indicate that it runs directly into the following
  paragraph. You should still try to make the summary self-contained when
  you do this.

Finally, it is not necessary (and is in fact bad style) to list all
the files a multi-file commit touches in the comment for it.  The
--name-status, --name-only, and --stat options of git log will report
this information to users who want it.  It is still appropriate
to list a file path if you have something specific to say about that
individual file, or if it's the only one touched in a single-file
change and you can easily fit it in the summary line along with your
summary.

Yes, we know the pre-git portions of the history violate some of these.
That was then; this is now.

=== How to refer to previous commits

The best (most human-friendly) way to reference a commit is by quoting its
summary line; if you need to disambiguate, give its date and author.

The worst way is to quote its git hash because humans are not good at
keeping random strings of hex digits in working memory.  Besides, hashes
will break if the history is ever moved to another VCS or the repository
has to be surgically altered.

=== Avoid unnecessary merge bubbles

There are two kinds of merge bubbles in git commit graphs. The
necessary kind happens because branches have genuinely diverged enough
that a merge by hand is required - common files have been touched in
incompatible ways. In the unnecessary kind, the patches on either side
of the bubble commute cleanly, but the developer on one side or the other
forgot to rebase so his commit would be a fast-forward.

We strongly dislike unnecessary merge bubbles.  They make the
repository history hard to read, and can make bisection tests
trickier. We prefer the code to have a simple, close-to-linear
history even if that means older commits are sometimes fast-forwarded
from new ones because a long-lived branch was rebased.

To avoid merge bubbles, git pull --rebase before pushing.  This will
pull all pending commits from the repo, then attempt to rebase your
local commits on the new tip.  You may find it helpful to set
"rebase = true" in your .git/config, so it looks like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
	rebase = true
-------------------------------------------------------------

Setting this option adds --rebase to all your pulls; this may cause
a minor inconvenience when you have uncommitted local changes; you
should be able to use "git stash" to get around that.

== Logging tags

To facilitate analysis of logs, log messages are tagged with an initial
topic group token.  These are:

AUTH:: Authorization-key handling
BUG:: Bugs in the code
CLOCK:: Low-level clock manipulation and validation checks & leap-second code
CONFIG:: Configuration parsing and interpretation
DEBUG:: Debugging, normally commented out
DNS:: DNS Lookup
ERR:: Low-level errors from resource-management libraries
INIT:: Daemon setup
LOG:: Log switching and debug levels
MAC:: Message authentication hash computation
MODE6:: Processing of Mode 6 requests
NTS, NTSc, NTSs:: Network Time Security, RFC xxxx, NTSs=>server, NTSc=>client
PROTO:: Protocol machine actions
REFCLOCK:: Reference clock and driver actions
RESTRICT:: Restrictions
SYNC:: Server synchronization

== Release Checklist

This is the release checklist to be used by the project manager to cut
each release.

. Decide that it is time to cut a release.  This decision can be driven
  by landing a significant new feature, landing a critical fix, or just
  that enough time has passed with ongoing improvements and fixes.

. Email a warning message to the mailto:devel@ntpsec.org list,
  and ask the major contributors to chime in, and to each assure
  that the .../NEWS file and the .../devel/TODO file is up to date.

. Wait for the contributors to answer and for the discussion
  to settle down.  If the discussion suggests that now is not a good
  time to cut a release, wait until the raised issues are resolved.

. Check with the buildbot reports, assure that there are no unplanned
  regressions on the supported platforms.

. Do the "Release Prep Steps" section below.

. Modify the .../VERSION file with the new version number.
  Version number strings look like "1.1.1"

. Modify the .../NEWS.adoc file, changing the "Repository head"
  to the current date and the version string.

. Run ./waf configure

. Run ./waf build

. cd ./devel

. Run the "./release | sh" script in this (devel) directory.

. Check https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec

. Post release announcement to blog.ntpsec.org

. Post release announcement to fediverse @ntpsec@fosstodon.org

. Post release announcement to email announce@ntpsec.org, devel@ntpsec.org, gpsd-dev@nongnu.org, ntp@ietf.org, time-nuts@lists.febo.com

. Modify the .../NEWS.adoc file, adding a new "Repository head" section.
