= README file for directory etc =

This directory contains example run-time configuration files for the
NTP daemon, and some example startup scripts for launching it.

Under ntp.d, the "use-" files are modular pieces of ntp.conf
files that you can string together in any order for effect.  The file
titles are clues to what they're useful for.  Each has an explanatory
header comment.  The file "default.conf" shows what a file made out of
use snippets is like.  This directory can be copied to /etc to
give a sane default configuration.

The rc files are start/stop scripts for NTP under System-V-style
init. They are intended as models for distribution packagers.

The *.service and *.timer files are for use with systemd.

Additional information can be found in the ./docs subdirectory of the
base directory.
