# Simplest possible refclock configuration for sites with a GPS primary source.
#
# Uses the shared-memory driver, accepting fixes from a running gpsd
# instance watching one PPS-capable GPS. Accepts in-band GPS time (not
# very good, likely to have jitter in the 100s of milliseconds) on one
# unit, and PPS time (almost certainly good to 1 ms or less) on
# another.  Prefers the latter.

# GPS Serial data reference (NTP0)
refclock shm unit 0 refid GPS

# GPS PPS reference (NTP1)
